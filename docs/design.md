# Design — PROJECT_NAME

<!-- TEMPLATE: this doc carries the reasoning. The tracker carries unbuilt
     scope, and this doc links to an issue rather than restating it. Write the
     premise first and leave the rest to grow as decisions get made. -->

## Premise

<!-- TEMPLATE: the premise is the one thing this project must get right, and
     the reason it must. Every ranking decision appeals back to it, so it is
     worth more than a sentence.

     marketlake's premise is capture reliability: a minute of option chain data
     not recorded at the moment it existed is gone forever, while everything
     computed from a captured minute can be recomputed. That asymmetry is what
     makes its capture path the one thing that never gets deferred.

     Name the equivalent asymmetry here. If nothing in the project is
     irreversible, say that, because it changes what the ranking rule in
     CLAUDE.md protects. -->

TODO.

## Vocabulary

Terms with exact definitions, reused on purpose. A term listed here is not a
candidate for a synonym. Anything not listed here follows the writing-style
rule in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md), which prefers deleting an in-group term to
glossing it.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| TODO | TODO |

## Configuration

<!-- TEMPLATE: name every secret, where it lives, and what reads it. The repo
     is public, so a secret in a tracked file is published. A machine-specific
     path is not a secret but still does not belong in a tracked file, because
     it is wrong on every other machine. -->

Machine-local config lives under `~/.config/PROJECT_NAME/`. Nothing tracked in
this repository carries a secret or a machine-specific path.

| Setting | Secret | Lives in | Read by |

## Considered and rejected

Machinery that was considered and cut, pinned here with the reason. The point
is that a decision stays decided. When something new is cut, add it here in
the same change that cuts it.

Reviews armor what exists and rarely ask whether it should exist, so this
register is also where the answer to "why is this needed" gets written down
once rather than re-argued.
